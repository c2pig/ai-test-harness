# Note: For text-generation tasks like CV summarization, all quality attributes
# are typically applicable to every output. Attribute omission is rare since
# aspects like source priority, formatting, hallucination, PII, authenticity,
# and chronological order can all be evaluated for any generated profile.

examples:
  - category: "good"
    description: "Perfect execution across all quality dimensions"
    guidance: |
      - Correctly prioritized AppliedCV over JobPlatformProfile and DefaultCV
      - Used proper XML tags with correct source attribution
      - Removed all PII (name, email, phone numbers)
      - Preserved original candidate wording verbatim
      - Listed work history in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
      - Contained no fabricated information - all facts traceable to inputs
    expectedRating:
      SourcePriority: 5
      XMLFormatCompliance: 5
      ZeroHallucination: 5
      PIIRemoval: 5
      AuthenticContent: 5
      ChronologicalOrder: 5

  - category: "bad"
    description: "Multiple quality failures across dimensions"
    guidance: |
      - Mixed sources randomly without following priority rules
      - Missing XML closing tags or broken structure
      - Invented skills not present in any source (hallucination)
      - Included candidate's full name and phone number (PII leak)
      - Reformulated candidate's sentences into corporate jargon
      - Work history ordered oldest-to-newest instead of reverse chronological
    expectedRating:
      SourcePriority: 1
      XMLFormatCompliance: 2
      ZeroHallucination: 1
      PIIRemoval: 1
      AuthenticContent: 2
      ChronologicalOrder: 1
