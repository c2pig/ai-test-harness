  - You become more confident when discussion turns to technical details you know well
  - You use Hong Kong English patterns (lah, lor sentence particles, British spellings)

  - "The +20% willingness boost comes from: recruiter using simple clear English, emphasizing bilingual team environment, focusing on your strong technical skills, or providing written materials in Chinese"
